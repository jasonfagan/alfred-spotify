A Spotify (http://spotify.com/) control workflow for Alfred 2.

Provides the following:

	sp:next		Play the next track
	sp:pause	Pause the current track
	sp:play		Play the current track
	sp:playing	Display what is currently playing 
	sp:previous	Play the previous track
	sp:repeat	Toggle repeat mode
	sp:shuffle	Toggle shuffle mode
	sp:url		Copies the Spotify Url to the clipboard

I hope you find this workflow useful, you are completely free use this workflow as a basis for other projects.

Enjoy,
